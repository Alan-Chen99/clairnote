TESTING PROCEDURES

Tests are .ly files in /test/tests/
Each test file includes:

  \include "../test-includes.ly"

"test-includes.ly" contains the version statement, the include statement for
"clairnote.ly", and other global settings.


1. Optionally edit test/tests/test-includes.ly to point to the "clairnote.ly"
file to be tested and version of LilyPond to be used.

2. Run the following command in a terminal, in the test directory. (This is on
GNU/Linux.)

  find ./tests/*.ly -exec lilypond -dno-point-and-click -o "pdfs-cn-dn"  {} \;

3. Uncomment "\clairnote-sn" in test-includes.ly and run the following command
in a terminal, in the test directory:

  find ./tests/*.ly -exec lilypond -dno-point-and-click -o "pdfs-cn-sn"  {} \;

4. The pdfs are in pdfs-cn-dn and pdfs-cn-sn folders.

5. Open old and new pdfs in Firefox (drag files onto dock icon) in a mostly
empty profile, use a tab sorting extension to sort the tabs, use ctrl+tab and
ctrl+shift+tab to switch between tabs and look for visual differences
between the old and new pdfs.

6. Rename the pdf directories with the date and "clairnote.ly" version number.

7. Create new empty directories pdfs-cn-dn and pdfs-cn-sn for next time.

8. Optionally delete much older pdf directories.
