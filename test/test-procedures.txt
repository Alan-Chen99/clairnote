TESTING PROCEDURES

Tests are .ly files in /test/tests/
Each test file includes:

  \include "../test-includes.ly"

"test-includes.ly" contains the version statement, the include statement for
"clairnote.ly", and other global settings.

The /test/clairnote-sn.ly file is used in the commands below to produce
Clairnote SN output.


STEPS

1. Optionally edit test/test-includes.ly to point to the "clairnote.ly"
file to be tested and version of LilyPond to be used.

2. Update the DATE variable and run the following commands in a terminal,
in the test directory (not the tests directory). (This is on GNU/Linux.)
The pdfs will be in DATE-pdfs-cn-dn and DATE-pdfs-cn-sn directories.

  DATE=2017-10-31; SN=$DATE-pdfs-cn-dn; DN=$DATE-pdfs-cn-sn;
  mkdir ${DN};
  find ./tests/*.ly -exec lilypond -dno-point-and-click -o ${DN} {} \;
  mkdir ${SN};
  find ./tests/*.ly -exec lilypond -dno-point-and-click -dinclude-settings="clairnote-sn.ly" -o ${SN} {} \;

3. Open old and new pdfs in Firefox (drag files onto dock icon) in a mostly
empty profile, use a tab sorting extension to sort the tabs, use ctrl+tab and
ctrl+shift+tab to switch between tabs and look for visual differences
between the old and new pdfs.

4. Optionally delete older pdf directories.
