TESTING PROCEDURES

Tests are .ly files in /test/tests/
Each test file includes:

  \include "../test-includes.ly"

"test-includes.ly" contains the version statement, the include statement for
"clairnote.ly", and other global settings.

The /test/clairnote-dn.ly file is used in the commands below to produce
Clairnote DN output.  (All this file does is set the clairnote-type setting.)


STEPS

1. Optionally edit test/test-includes.ly to point to the "clairnote.ly"
file to be tested and version of LilyPond to be used.

2. run the following commands in a terminal,

./test.py -o ./sn-2023-01-03
./test.py -dn -o ./dn-2023-01-03

# optional: lilypond regression tests
path/to/test.py path/to/lilypond-src/input/regression/* -o ./lilypond-rgressions-sn -i test-includes.ly
path/to/test.py path/to/lilypond-src/input/regression/* -o ./lilypond-rgressions-dn -dn -i test-includes.ly

3. Open old and new pdfs in Firefox in a mostly empty profile,
use a tab sorting extension to sort the tabs, use ctrl+tab and
ctrl+shift+tab to switch between tabs and look for visual differences
between the old and new pdfs.

4. Optionally delete older pdf directories.
