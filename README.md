Code for creating sheet music in Clairnote music notation with GNU LilyPond.

See http://clairnote.org/software/ for documentation.

Note: I started working on this project well before I knew git, and
had been manually keeping a version history and change log.
When I set up this repo I recreated that history in git for future reference.
So thats why there are so many commits on Feb 1, 2017.
The actual dates of those changes are in the commit messages.
