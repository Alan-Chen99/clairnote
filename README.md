A repo for the code for typesetting Clairnote sheet music with GNU LilyPond.  

See http://clairnote.org/software/

Note: 
I started working on this project well before I knew git.
I had a system for 'manually' keeping a history of all versions of the file.
It took me awhile to get around to setting up this repo because...
I wanted to recreate the history in git for future reference.
So the commits on Feb 1, 2017 are recreating the history.
Their actual dates are included in the commit messages.
